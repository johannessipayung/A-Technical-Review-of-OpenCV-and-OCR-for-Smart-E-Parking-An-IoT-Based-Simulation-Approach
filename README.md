# A-Technical-Review-of-OpenCV-and-OCR-for-Smart-E-Parking-An-IoT-Based-Simulation-Approach
The title "A Technical Review of OpenCV and OCR for Smart E-Parking: An IoT-Based Simulation Approach" refers to a study that explores the use of OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technologies in the development of a smart electronic parking system. This system leverages IoT-based simulations where a camera captures vehicle license plates, processes the images using OpenCV for detection and character segmentation, and then applies OCR (such as Tesseract) to extract readable text. The main objective is to automate vehicle identification and entry processes, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of parking management.

This review not only discusses the technical aspects of implementing OpenCV and OCR, but also examines how these technologies can be integrated into an IoT-based simulation using microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi. It highlights practical challenges such as processing speed, recognition accuracy, and hardware requirements, while also emphasizing the potential for real-world applications. By evaluating these components, the study provides a solid technical foundation for future development of cost-effective and user-friendly smart e-parking systems.
